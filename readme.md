## All For One API Backend

## Description: Created an API that is hosted on Microsoft Azure as a web app. The API has mutliple endpoints you can call from consisting of mini challenges/games : 
##      -Hello World
##      -Asking Questions
##      -Adding Two Numbers
##      -Mad Lib
##      -Odd Or Even
##      -Reverse It (Alphanumeric)
##      -Reverse It (Numbers Only)
##      -Magic 8 Ball
##      -Guess It
##      -Restaurant Picker

## Peer review - Brandon Van Horn - code runs well and i liked you madlib story and i found some of the get projects dont check for invalid endpoints but some do good work on that but might want to add more error checking
